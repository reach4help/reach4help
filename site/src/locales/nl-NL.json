        "Our humble mission started out as a small peer-to-peer platform to help those who needed it most during the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020. Since then, Reach4Help has evolved into a tech nonprofit offering other organizations access to a vast network of organizations. We now connect hundreds of thousands of people with the resources they need.",
        "We work with a variety of organizations on the ground across the globe, ranging from local charities to national helpline call centers. When one of our partner organizations receives a request for help, we use our mutual aid map and NGO dashboard to facilitate a connection between the requesting party and the organization(s) that can help.",
        "With over 600 volunteers across 25 countries and 6 continents, we're connecting communities in need to food banks, charity events, and day-to-day services worldwide. Together, we're building a network of help to keep us stronger and more connected through COVID-19 and beyond."
