Since then, Reach4Help has evolved into a tech nonprofit offering other organizations access to a vast network of organizations. We now connect hundreds of thousands of people with the resources they need.",

When one of our partner organizations receives a request for help, we use our mutual aid map and NGO dashboard to facilitate a connection between the requesting party and the organization(s) that can help.",
