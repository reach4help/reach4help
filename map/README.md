# COVID-19 Mutual Aid Map

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### Development: `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

For google maps to work when you're testing development, you need to have an API key that allows you to use it.

We don't include a key that is permitted to be used locally as that would incur costs for us.

To use your own key when testing development (or when running the build) please set the `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` environment variable.

You can also specify this variable in a `.env` file to avoid entering it on the command line every time you run `yarn start`.
